# Blog Website With TypeScript, NestJS, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, and SwaggerJS

This is a blog Post Website that I created while experimenting with NestJS, I also used some technology along side with it, which are:

- Typescript: for type checking in javascript
- NestJS: a nodejs framework which was built on top express a nodejs light weight framework.
- PostgreSQL: the RDBMS that was used to store the blog post, comments and all in the database.
- TypeORM: the ORM which is used to connect the database.
- SwaggerJS: for the API documentation.
